# TheImperialGod
# Features
TheImperialGod is a perfect bot with plenty of utilities and good for server owners!
<br>
With a nice themed base and some useful features, comes at you TheImperialGod

## Introduction
Before touching the code and stuff please read till the end of the MD file. There is a ton of important information in this README file. Also once you read this, read the code of conduct. <br>

You can choose whether or not you want to read CONTRIBUTING.md, as do it only if you want to contribute, as some of the code is hard for inexperienced programmers. And leave it if your new here, as first check out the bot!

## Moderation
Has advanced moderation features for all people with using the concept of embeds and more! <br> Cool right? It also has automoderation features that's customizable, which makes it perfect for you and your servers! <br>

The bot is even smart enough NOT to filter automod in NSFW channels even if its enabled!

## Economy
Okay economy systems are hard, they take about 1000 lines just to write a shop and have a wallet and arcade system. See this is hard!

But don't worry I have used a database system called .json (JavaScript Object Notation)

## Utilities
Yes, TheImperialGod has plenty of utility features including a changing status that changes his status every 10 seconds, which to me is really cool.

Now, it also has coinflip and plenty of stuff, so yeah have fun with your friends.
So till now good going and before you touch the code.

## Giveaways
So we have some Giveaway features which simply reroll and start a giveaway, kinda basic but that's all we have for the bot. The rest of the commands are just customizable

We have error handling for all commands! 

## Contribution
Contribute by first reading Contributing.md and then later on, fork and send it back to `nightzan999@gmail.com`.

If your stuff gets approved it gets into the source and to the public bot. Don't worry we WILL give you credits. 

## Issues
Issues with the public bot will probably be outages and we cannot help those, rather than making them, please refrain from doing that.

You have the code in front of you, please download it and host it. 

## Self Hosting? Public Bot?
### Self Hosting
Yes this is the most important place here. <br>**Note:** Self hosting is suggested as the public bot goes offline sometimes and that may disrupt your giveaways.

Just in bot.py check the bot token and replace it with yours. As TheImperialGod doesn't have changing prefixes, so change the prefix as well if you would like!

But GIVE THE CREDITS, if you don't you can be doing illegal activity due to the MIT LICENSE. If you keep the credits and don't brag that you made the bot. Its fine that you can use the bot!

### Steps for Self Hosting
1. Download Python from [here](https://python.org) (lastest version please)
2. Remember the website files are in "views" and some website files are in the main directory, if you're hosting the bot then you should see TheImperialGod folder because that is where the source files of the bot is going to be
3. Then download the bot files either by downloading as a zip in github or doing `git clone https://github.com/NightZan999/TheImperialGod/tree/main/TheImperialGod`, make sure you have git installed and the github CLI (Client Line Interface)
4. Then unzip the zipped folder.
5. Then go to cmd of that directory and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Then immediately go to cmd and type `python bot.py`.
7. The bot is running and use the invite link to invite it to your server, replace the client id with your bots client id. 
8. Enjoy the bot! <br>
**Note:** TheImperialGod uses an old version of discord.py as listed in requirements.txt, which means if you just `pip install` all the modules listed it WON'T work!

Thanks for your patience.

### Public Bot
I guess you're a new programmer. <br>**Note:** This code may be hard for inexperienced programmers, so if you don't understand stuff, just add the public bot.

You can find the invite link in the main bot file, just copy paste that into your browser, so yes continue and the bot is here!

Or of course if you don't know how to read variables simply click [this!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=768695035092271124&scope=bot&permissions=21474836398)

He will be up most of the time, but when he is down please cope with it!
But anyways, if you are interested in the public bot. Then you are in the currency system, and if you want coins join my server where there are giveaways happening.

# Suggestions and More:
If you tested the bot and loved it, but thought you would want to give in some suggestions, please first don't make an issue. 

Firstly you should simply, check BETA_FEATURES.md for some new things the bot might get, if your suggestion is an improvement first search for a similar suggestion in the issues, if there are none then make a new one. 

Otherwise you also can suggest stuff in my discord server, so you could join it and make things easy!

# Resources:

You may be thinking 'How do I keep my self hosted bot up 24/7?', so to make things easy, we're giving you a list of hosting services you could use!

**1. Heroku.**
Heroku is a really good hosting service, with the only problem being it doesn't let you store data.
You could YouTube a video on how to host a python bot with Heroku.

**2. Repl.it.**

Repl.it is a great hosting service that also stores data, with the only problem being that others could view your code and data. **This includes your bot token. You can fix this by buying repl.it premium or using a .env file.**

Along with these are many others, like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS, DanBot hosting and many more. You could use those as well.
